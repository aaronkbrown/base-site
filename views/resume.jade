        p I've been creating with technology my entire life, from tinkering in BASIC during elementary school to studying video game scripting languages during college, and everything in between. I have recently completed an intense 8-week UX engineering training course translating static designs into planned, executed, and delivered web prototypes in a collaborative environment, and I am prepared to hit the ground running as a front end developer.
